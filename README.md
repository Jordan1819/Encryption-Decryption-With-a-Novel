# Encryption-Decryption Using a Novel (C#)

## Project Goal
This project was created as a way to **practice and understand encryption and decryption concepts** while building a multi-class C# program.  
The main focus is on learning how to design and implement custom **encryption and decryption classes** using a "book code" format with the novel *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen.

## Description
The program demonstrates:
- Designing multiple classes in a larger program  
- Reading and modifying `.txt` files  
- String manipulation, dictionaries, and lists  
- Passing data between classes  

### How It Works
The program encodes and decodes messages using the text of *Pride and Prejudice*.  
- A **dictionary** (`Dictionary<string, int>`) is built where:  
  - **Keys** = words in the novel  
  - **Values** = the number of times each word appears in the text  
- **Encoding**: The program maps words from the user’s message to their index values in the book, creating an "encoded message" made up of integer representations.  
- **Decoding**: The program takes those integer values and looks them up in the book to reconstruct the original message.  

This mimics a traditional **"book code" cipher** and demonstrates both encryption and decryption through custom-built classes.
